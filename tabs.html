		<p id="bio">Sougwen Chung is an interdisciplinary artist whose work explores transitional edges – where the mark-made-by-hand meets the mark-made-by-machine, where light meets 	sound, and form meets formlessness.  If drawing is an analogy for basic human expression, then what does that mean when drawings are hybridized/catalyzed with software, sound, light, and space? Working across print, digital and environmental mediums, Sougwen’s immersive work plays with contrasts and transitions, when those liminal experiences where our human-ness is thrown into high relief by our use of and ever-deepening relationship with technology.</p>
		<p id="bio">A Chinese-Canadian based in New York, Sougwen has a BFA in graphic design and a diploma in Interactive Art from Hyper Island in Sweden. Her interdisciplinary process spans drawing, video, animation, 3d, sound and installation.  An internationally exhibited artist, her work has been shown at The Art Directors Club in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Geneva, Switzerland, amongst others. Her work has been featured in The New Yorker, Dazed and Confused, and Creators Project, and her client list includes Chanel, Jagermeister, Nike, and Ghostly International, along with musicians Tom Waits and Sepalcure.</p>
